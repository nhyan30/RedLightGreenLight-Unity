# 🟢 Red Light, Green Light – Unity Game

## 🎮 Game Summary

This Unity project is a reimagined, high-intensity version of the iconic “Red Light, Green Light” game inspired by *Squid Game*. The objective is simple yet challenging: **reach the finish line within one minute without being caught**.

What sets this game apart is its **realistic movement physics** and **AI-powered NPCs**, making each round dynamic and unpredictable. Players must balance speed with precision as they accelerate, decelerate, and react to sudden changes—timing is everything.

## 🕹️ Core Gameplay

- **Start Line**: The game begins with the main player and a group of autonomous NPCs at the starting point.
- **The Doll**: A large robotic doll stands at the finish line, facing away from the players.
- **Green Light**: When the doll shouts “Green Light,” players can **hold the Up Arrow key** to move forward. The longer they run, the faster they go.
- **Red Light**: At random intervals, the doll shouts “Red Light” and quickly turns around to scan for movement. **Any player still moving will be eliminated**.
- **Deceleration Mechanics**: Movement physics play a key role—players need time to decelerate after releasing the movement key. **Stopping too late means game over**.
- **Dynamic Tempo**: As the game progresses, the doll’s music tempo increases, **reducing the window to safely stop**, and raising the stakes.
